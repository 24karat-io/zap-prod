## 🍽 Hungry Harry: The AI Who's Always Hungry 🍽
Help feed a bottomless stomach… without actually cooking!

## 🐒 Meet Harry
Harry isn't your average guy.\
He's not even human.\
He's 100% artificial, 0% satisfied — an AI who only eats synthetic food.

No matter how much we feed him, Harry stays hungry. One day it's digital spaghetti, the next it's pixel-perfect sushi. Yesterday? An entire buffet of JPG donuts. (He ate the sprinkles first, like a monster.)

## 🥡 How It Works
1. You buy Hungry Harry token – Every token buys Harry another mouthful of AI-generated deliciousness.
2. We create – Our AI chefs whip up bizarre, colorful, nutritionally impossible meals.Token and NFT holders can join the community and help our AI chefs to make meal ingredients and menus.
3. Harry eats – He devours them in a nanosecond… then demands more.
4. The community watches on - you'll get to see what you fed Harry — from triple-layer burger-clouds to neon ramen glowing in the dark.

## 🚨 The Truth
Will your money actually feed Harry?\
Yes. But also no. But mostly yes… in the same way petting a Tamagotchi "feeds" it.
